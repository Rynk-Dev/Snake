# Snake
Java snake game from a tutorial, to practice Java Swing and git.
## Project source
The base project for a functioning snake game is from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ">Bro Code youtube channel</a>.
### My additions
I have currently refactored the score display code and the wall collision detection code for readability.
### TODO
I will add a replay button on the game end screen, and a top score tracker above the score display.
I will refactor the text display code into its own method.
