# Snake
Java snake game from a tutorial, to practice Java Swing and git.
## Project source
The base project for a functioning snake game is from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bI6e6qjJ8JQ">Bro Code youtube channel</a>.
### My additions
<ul>
  <li>
    I have refactored the score display code and the wall collision detection code for readability.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have added a replay function to the game end screen, which resets the game when Enter is pressed.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have added a top score tracker to the screen that will track the top session score.
  </li>
  <li>
    I have prevented the apple from spawning inside the body of the snake.
  </li>
</ul>
